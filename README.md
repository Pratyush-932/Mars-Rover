# Mars-Rover
Open Projects 2021

## Abstract
The **Mars Rover** is a small vehicle built to cover mars like terrains. It is made to cover ueneven surfaces with ease and further to collect and analyze data. It has a robotic arm for data collection process and contains various sensors to recieve and record the data. It also has cameras and lidar sensors for visual data interpretation and navigation.

## Motivation
The Mars rover project helps us to learn the mechanisms and functioning of an actual rover sent to Mars under various space programmes. 

It gives us an insight on the **Rocker Bogie** suspension system which facilitates the best possible movement of the Rover on challenging terrains. It also compelled us to think about a mechainism for a compact and fully functioning robotic arm which would be used to collect sample data.

The project also sheds light on the various sensors used by the rover for data collection and analysis as well as for its navigation. Lidar and PIXL are the senosrs used by us in the rover.
